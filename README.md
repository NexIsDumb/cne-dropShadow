# Drop Shadow Shader Stage Extension for Codename Engine

This is a stage extension that adds the drop shadow shader used in V-Slice to Codename Engine. (The shader you see in the senpai and tankmen erect stages)

In your stage xml file, put in `<use-extension script="dropshadow-effect"/>` to import the script.
